A framework for adding semantic metadata to React components, making them "agent-aware" for AI systems and automation tools.

# NOT FINISHED

## Overview

Agentify Components solves the problem of making UI components understandable to AI agents. When AI assistants interact with web applications, they typically lack context about what components do, how to interact with them, and what data they handle.

This framework adds a semantic layer to your components through decorators that:

1. **Register component metadata** - Define what a component does and how it behaves
2. **Provide a standardized schema** - Create consistent metadata structures for different component types
3. **Generate configuration files** - Create MCP (Mission Control Protocol) configurations at build time

> 🚀 **Note:** This framework focuses on *component metadata* rather than behavior modification. It makes your components "self-describing" to AI systems without changing their functionality.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @anvos/agentify-components
```

## Core Concepts

### Component Types

Agentify currently supports three main component types:

- **Search Bars** - For search inputs with navigation or API behavior
- **Forms** - For data collection with field-level metadata
- **Buttons** - For actions with navigation, API, or UI interaction behaviors

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by Anthropic to connect AI models with external data sources and tools. It uses a client-server architecture, allowing AI assistants to access live data from various systems like Google Drive, Slack, or databases, enhancing their responses with up-to-date context134. MCP simplifies integrations by providing a universal protocol for secure and standardized connections, replacing custom API connectors with reusable MCP servers

### Framework Architecture

The framework consists of four main parts:

1. **Decorator (@AgentConfig)** - Attaches metadata to components, including common fields and protocol-specific configurations
2. **Transformers** - Adapt the generic metadata into protocol-specific formats (e.g., for protocols like MCP for now but will be extended to other protocols in the future)
3. **Generators** - Produce server file content based on the transformed configurations, tailored to each protocol
4. **CLI Tool** - Processes components, applies the appropriate transformer and generator based on the target protocol, and outputs the server file

This architecture ensures flexibility—developers can define components once and support multiple protocols by adding new transformers and generators as needed.

## Usage

### Agentifying a Search Bar

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { AgentConfig } from '@anvos/agentify-components';

// Add semantic metadata using decorator
@AgentConfig({
  type: 'search',
  behavior: {
    type: 'api',
    endpoint: '/api/products/search',
    method: 'GET',
    queryParam: 'term'
  },
  description: 'Search for products in the catalog',
 
})
export class ProductSearch extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <input 
        type="search" 
        onChange={(e) => this.props.onSearch?.(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Search..." 
      />
    );
  }
}
```

### Agentifying a Form

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { AgentConfig } from '@anvos/agentify-components';

// Add semantic metadata using decorator
@AgentConfig({
  type: 'form',
  behavior: {
    type: 'api',
    endpoint: '/api/auth/login',
    method: 'POST'
  },
  fields: [
    { name: 'username', type: 'text', required: true },
    { name: 'password', type: 'password', required: true }
  ],
  purpose: 'user-authentication',
  description: 'User login form for account access'
})
export class LoginForm extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.props.onSubmit}>
        {/* Form fields */}
        <input type="text" name="username" />
        <input type="password" name="password" />
        <button type="submit">Login</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

### Agentifying a Button

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { AgentConfig } from '@anvos/agentify-components';

// Add semantic metadata using decorator
@AgentConfig({
  type: 'button',
  behavior: {
    type: 'navigation',
    href: '/checkout'
  },
  label: 'Proceed to Checkout',
  description: 'Navigate to checkout page to complete purchase'
})
export class CheckoutButton extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.props.onClick}>
        {this.props.children}
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

## Generating MCP Configuration

During your build process, you can generate an MCP server. Add these scripts to your package.json:

```javascript
"scripts": {
  "build:mcp": "agentify-mcp-build",
  "deploy:mcp": "agentify-mcp-deploy"
}
```

Then run the build command to generate your MCP configuration:

```bash
npm run build:mcp
```

This will scan your codebase for agentified components and generate an MCP server configuration file in the `/mcp` directory.

To deploy your MCP server:

```bash
npm run deploy:mcp
```

This will deploy your MCP server to the Anvos community MCP servers on GitHub where users can easily access it. Your configuration will be available via a unique URL that you can share with AI systems and tools that support the MCP protocol.

Overview of the Framework
The framework consists of four main parts:

Decorator (@AgentConfig): Attaches metadata to components, including common fields and protocol-specific configurations.
Transformers: Adapt the generic metadata into protocol-specific formats (e.g., for protocols like MCP or XYZ).
Generators: Produce server file content based on the transformed configurations, tailored to each protocol.
CLI Tool: Processes components, applies the appropriate transformer and generator based on the target protocol, and outputs the server file.
This design ensures flexibility—developers can define components once and support multiple protocols by adding new transformers and generators as needed.
